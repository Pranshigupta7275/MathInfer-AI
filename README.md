# 🔢 MathInfer-AI  
### A Smart Math Helper Built with FastAPI + Next.js + Gemini

MathInfer-AI is a math-focused chatbot that I built to help with solving different types of mathematical problems.  
The idea behind this project was to create something that feels like a real assistant for learning – with clean explanations, step-by-step solutions, and support for multiple input types like images, PDFs, and voice.

This project also helped me explore full-stack development, LLM integration, and modern UI building.
